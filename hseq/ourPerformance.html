                      <h3>For Italy: our new advertising campaign</h3> 
                      <p>Eni’s story continues to be written every day by thousands of men and women around the world. Their experience and the specifics of their work provide the inspiration for the firm’s latest advertising campaign. Although it is an innovative company, always looking to the future, Eni nevertheless holds true to its history and its values; it has always talked about innovation, dialogue, co-operation and culture. The six-legged dog, which these days is called upon to represent a wider array of meanings than ever, shows that we are able to maintain our link with a history that goes back over 60 years while facing a new set of challenges.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Eni for Italy: our new advertising campaign</h3> 
                      <p>The new advertising campaign is dedicated to Eni’s initiatives and commitments in Italy. It focuses on five examples of how the company’s ideas have been made into reality around the country – and how they will continue to be so, thanks to the work and commitment of Eni people. By folding the paper on which the plans are drawn, their hands turn the blueprints into tangible objects that symbolise the subject under discussion: the sun for solar energy; a car for biofuels; a mask for training using virtual reality; and a rucksack for the Work Placements for Schools programme.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Our new advertising campaign</h3>                      
                      <p>
                        The first Eni for Italy advert reveals how we are producing solar energy by reclaiming previously unusable sites.
                        Eni and the future of energy: the second advert in our campaign.
                        <br>

                        The next advert in our campaign describes the specific actions we have been taking to change our approach to energy and safeguarding our planet. Once again the hands of Eni employees are the stars of the clip, searching every day for tangible solutions to reducing CO2 emissions. Every gesture and action represents the company’s commitment, the progress it is making and its continuous investment in the future. The images transport us to Africa, where we have managed to turn excess gas into electricity. The truth required no embellishment in the making of the advert because the reality of what Eni’s hands achieve is surprising enough. Climate change is a problem that can be put off no longer; a new energy model is needed to tackle it. For years, Eni has been developing technologies to supplement fossil fuels sustainably through a strategy based on energy efficiency, the use of natural gas, investment in renewable energy and research into solar energy.

                      </p>
                      <h3>The 2015 campaign</h3>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Since its foundation, Eni has put people and substance at the heart of its work.</li>
                          <li>Key traits for the company are courage, trust in the future and in new ideas.</li>
                          <li>So too are flexibility and the ability to anticipate and follow through change</li>
                          <li>Essential if we are to be able to adapt to all possible scenarios, both national and international</li>
                          <li>So new value can continue to be created. Today, despite facing many challenges</li>
